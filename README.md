## Project Overview
In discussing potential topics for our final project, our group concluded that taking a look at current events would provide the most interesting and relevant project and challenge. Ultimately, it was decided that we would take a look at the state of the stock market in general around the time of the Great Depression and compare the effects of quantitative easing on the market then as compared to that which we are experiencing now. 

Our goal is to utlize the tools we have at our disposal to develop an algorithm which will be able to predict the trajectory of our market is based on varying factors from the past. One of the questions we hope to answer is whether or not one  can predict the length of this current downturn due to the Pandemic by looking for clues in economic and market data from our historical periods?
